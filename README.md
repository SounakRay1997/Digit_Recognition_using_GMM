# Digit_Recognition_using_GMM

This project is used to perform isolated recognition of English digits using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). We train a GMM model for each digit using the 39-dimensional MFCC features. The log-likelihood of each frame is then added for the testing data to find the true label of a spoken utterance.
